 # djvudict SQLite database schema (interpreted as “shapes”)

 This document describes the SQLite database produced by djvudict (minidjvu-mod based).

 Terminology (synchronized with Shape Browser)
 - djvudict calls the table letters, but in our terminology these are shapes.
 - A “shape” row can represent:
 - a dictionary entry (stored),
 - a drawn/placed shape on a page,
 - a non-symbol bitmap record.

 Source of truth: docs/from Trufanov/sqlstorage.cpp and tools/jb2dumper.cpp.

## Table: forms
Represents top-level DjVu components that djvudict iterates over (DIRM entries).

Columns:
- id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- position INTEGER UNIQUE NOT NULL
- entry_name TEXT NOT NULL
- type INTEGER NOT NULL
  - 1 = FORM:DJVU (page component; may contain Sjbz)
  - 2 = FORM:DJVI (shared component; may contain Djbz, but may also be non-dictionary data such as shared annotations)
- path_to_dump TEXT (dump folder)

How djvudict recognizes “dictionary” DJVI components:
- For type=2 components, djvudict looks for a Djbz chunk inside the DJVI form (see JB2Dumper::dumpDjbz searching for CHUNK_ID_Djbz).
- If no Djbz chunk is found, the component is treated as “not a JB2 dictionary” and nothing is dumped.
- In our sample database, such non-dictionary DJVI components have empty path_to_dump.

 ## Table: sjbz_info
 Metadata for page forms (Sjbz).

 Columns:
 - form_id INTEGER UNIQUE NOT NULL → forms.id
 - djbz_id INTEGER NULL → forms.id (shared dict used by this page)
 - width, height INTEGER NOT NULL
 - dpi INTEGER NOT NULL
 - version INTEGER NOT NULL

 ---

 ## Table: letters (Shapes)
 Stores extracted shapes / events from JB2 decoding.

 Columns:
 - id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
 - form_id INTEGER NOT NULL → forms.id
 - local_id INTEGER NULL (dictionary index within that form)
 - x, y INTEGER (placement coordinates if in_image=1)
 - width, height INTEGER NOT NULL
 - in_image INTEGER NOT NULL (0/1)
 - in_library INTEGER NOT NULL (0/1)
 - is_non_symbol INTEGER NOT NULL (0/1)
 - reference_id INTEGER NULL → letters.id (prototype link)
 - is_refinement INTEGER (0/1; see note below)
 - filename TEXT (dumped BMP path/name)

 Index:
 - CREATE INDEX index_letters ON letters(form_id, local_id)

 ## Coordinate convention for (x, y) in djvudict DB

 djvudict stores coordinates in bottom-left origin for placed shapes.
 In the decoder code (tools/jb2dumper.cpp) it repeatedly applies:
 - y = page_h - y; // return (0,0) to left bottom corner

 Important nuance: rows with in_image=0 often store x=0, y=0 intentionally (dictionary-only entries have no placement).

 ---

 ## Semantics of flags

 The SQLite fields are set directly in tools/jb2dumper.cpp:

 - in_image=1 means the shape is placed/drawn on the page.
 - in_library=1 means the shape is stored in a dictionary (local or shared).
 - is_non_symbol=1 occurs for JB2 “non-symbol data” records.

 ---

 ## Prototype/refinement relationship (reference_id)

 For “matched symbol with refinement” records, djvudict stores a link to a prototype via reference_id and marks is_refinement.

 Caution: in the current upstream source, at least one handler named “copy without refinement” still appears to record is_refinement=1.
 So treat is_refinement as “derived from another shape” rather than a perfect “refinement vs copy” truth label unless verified on your dataset.

 ## Worked example workflow using the sample DB

 Using samples/djvu_sqlite.db (SQLite):

 1) List forms (pages and shared dictionaries):
  SELECT id, position, entry_name, type FROM forms ORDER BY position;

 2) For a page form, get its page size and optional shared dict:
  SELECT f.entry_name, s.width, s.height, s.dpi, s.djbz_id
  FROM sjbz_info s
  JOIN forms f ON f.id = s.form_id
  WHERE s.form_id = <page_form_id>;

 3) List placed shapes (occurrences) on that page:
  SELECT local_id, x, y, width, height
  FROM letters
  WHERE form_id = <page_form_id> AND in_image = 1
  ORDER BY local_id;

 4) List dictionary-only shapes for a Djbz form (shared dictionary):
  SELECT local_id, width, height, filename
  FROM letters
  WHERE form_id = <djbz_form_id> AND in_library = 1 AND in_image = 0
  ORDER BY local_id;
